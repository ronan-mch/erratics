This tool provides a simple interface to enable users to compare their SFX holdings and those of an Aleph extract file. It is intended for use cases where some resources have been registered in Aleph but not in SFX. Using this tool, users can identify resources missing in the SFX. The resulting list can be viewed online or downloaded as a csv.
